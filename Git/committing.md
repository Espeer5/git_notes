# Committing in Detail
- When to commit:
    * It is a good idea to commit feature by feature - "atomic"
    * This way, if we want to roll back a certain feature, we can easily do so by reverting that particular commit
- Commit messages:
    - Use present tense, imperative style i.e "change ___ to version 2"
