# Brief History of OOD Principles
* OOD is a modern approach suited to the functionality and magnitude of modern software
* Early computer programs were:
    -  Simple sets of instructions
    - Written in binary or ASM
        * Too low level/verbose to accomplish highly sophisticated tasks
        * Literally take the form of instruction sets for hardware
* This means they were process focused - 
    - A program accomplished a process or series of processes
    - If a process changed, very little of the existing code base could still be used, because the whole new process now needed to be encoded00
* As hardware became packaged into embedded systems, computer systems became morea ccessible
    - Anyopne could build a system by using packaaged, general use components to develop their system
* OOD is an attempt to accompliosh the same thing, but with software
    - Software objects become packaged, common use components which are suited for solving common problems
    - These software objects can not only perform processes, they can also store and manipulate data, adding levels of complexity over hardware objects
