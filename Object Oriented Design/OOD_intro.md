# An Intro to key OOD Ideas
* A focus on Objects
    - software defined objects are a piece of data built for a sepcific purpose
    - All processes in OOD are defined as the interaction between different objects
    - Aloongside the literal piece of data, we store the ways in which the data may be altered or alter other data - these are the objects 'methods'
* Classes
    - Categorizations of objects that define the type of entity an object is
    - Allow the programmer to define hierarchy and "engage with ideas of specialization and generalization"
* Abstract Specification of Functionality
    - In OOD, the functionality of objects is defined through interfaces
    - This is abstract, because interfaces tell WHAT an object does, and never HOW it accomplishes those things
    - (Can also be called an abstract class)
    - Like a contract telling the eventual implementor what they must include, and therefore formalizes the rules of the system
* UML - unified modelling language standardizes OOD descriptions
* Design patterns - standard solutions for OOD problems
