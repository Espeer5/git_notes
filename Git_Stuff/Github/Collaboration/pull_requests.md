# Pull Requests - An Approval Mechanism for Changes
- These are features built into Git storage tools like Github or Gitlab, not a Git feature
- Pull requests alert team members that new work is ready to be reviewed for merging into the main branch
- These allow us to provide a description, and setup the official approval mechanism so that companies can organize how anything gets merged into the main branch
