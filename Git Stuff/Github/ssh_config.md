# SSH Config
* When we clone/push/pull from Github, it is most convenient to do so via ssh
* We simply need to generate a personal ssh key on our machine, and copy the public key over to Github
* This allows us to be identified, set up an ssh connection, and not have to give username/password any time we want to edit a repo
* Instructions for setting up the ssh key are available in Github help
